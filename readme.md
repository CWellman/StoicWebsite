StoicThoughts
Welcome

This is a website I developed which is devoted to stoicism. Stoicism is a great philosophy for getting through hard times in life. Stoicism has helped me greatly in my life and I hope it does yours aswell. the first home page is simply an introduction to stoicusm and the virtues. the control page is where the dichotomy of Control (a key component of stoicism) is discussed. the philosophers page is a page that introduces three of the most prominent philosophers and states their primary work and links to their wikipedia page. finaly the wisdom page is a page where I have a quote generator that generataes stoic quotes from many of histories most famous figures. This site is ment to only be a short introduction to stoicism but at the bottom of each page there are links to other websites with more information and a bigger community. Happy Studdies!
