			<h2>Externals</h2>
			<p>Externals are the things that are beyond our control. These include things such as polotics other peoples opinions weather and the like.
				These are well beyond our control but we all get very upset and worried about such things.
				 It is true we can influence these things however we do not have control over them. 
				 Many people focus on this too much and worry about things that are not in our control. 
				Stoics hold that this is a waste of energy as our worry will do no good.</p>

		<div class="secondary col">
			<h2>Internals</h2>
			<p>Internals are what is in our control. These include things as how we treat ourselves if and how we approach things. We may not always be in a favorable situation but we can chose how we approach it. 
				our attitude is under our control. Our preparedness is under our control. Stoics say these are the things we should focus on the most. 
				If we work with what is in our control it will better prepare us  what is not and have a better influence our future.
